# WhatsAppX
WhatsApp client and server source for iOS 5+, with planned support for iOS 3 & 4.  

This project is currently in beta. Please report bugs in bag-xml’s Discord server -> `Requests` -> `WhatsApp for Legacy iOS`. When reporting bugs, please give **as much detail as you can.** Simply writing “my app crashes” or “chats don’t pop up” won’t help me much in diagnosing the issue.
